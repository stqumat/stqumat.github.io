I work in birational geometry.

I am currently a research assistant professor at the Institute of Geometry and Physics, University of Science and Technology of China [(USTC-IGP)](https://igp.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm).

I was a postdoc at Yau Mathematical Sciences Center, Tsinghua University [(Tsinghua-YMSC)](https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) from 2020 to 2023 under the supervision of Prof. [Caucher Birkar](https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1031/1892.htm).

I received my Ph.D. in 2020 from Stony Brook University [(SUNY-SBU)](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu) under the supervision of Prof. [Jason Starr](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~jstarr/). 

I obtained my B.Sc. in 2014 from the University of Science and Technology of China [(USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn).
